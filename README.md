Roadmap
===

- [] Nicer REPL (formatting, colors etc)
- [] Enhancements to `gogpt config` command: more configurable options (max tokens, temperature etc)
- [] Configurable prompts (i.e. "Write me <foo> in the style of <bar>" where user only needs to type <foo> and <bar>)
- [] REPL Sessions (make pass previous context in the next request, i.e. ask something, hit enter, ask to elaborate on previous response)
- [] REPL History (up/down arrows)
- [] REPL Ctrl+Enter to enter a new line
- [] REPL Option+B / Option+F to jump words, Ctrl+W to delete backward, etc, all the shell goodies to navigate (or vim-like nav?)
- [] REPL Completions and commands, i.e. something like what postgresql has, or redis, i.e. being able to type `\config renderer=markdown`, or `\prompt ...`
